# NLP-Based-Twitter-Text-Analysis
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and process Twitter text data. It involves tokenization, n-gram modeling, and probabilistic language modeling using NLTK and scikit-learn. 
The project is structured into multiple parts, likely performing tasks such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and potential classification or sentiment analysis.

# Project Description
The key functionalities of the project include:

1. Data Loading: Reads Twitter text data from an external file stored on Google Drive.
2. Text Preprocessing:
a. Sentence splitting
b. Tokenization using nltk.word_tokenize
c. N-gram model creation (likely for text prediction or language modeling)
3. Probabilistic Language Modeling:
* Utilizes Lidstone smoothing for probability distributions
4. Machine Learning:
* Uses train_test_split from sklearn (potentially for training/testing NLP models)
The project might aim to perform language modeling, sentiment analysis, or text classification based on Twitter data.
